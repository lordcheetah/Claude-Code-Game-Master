"""Tests for scene-context-consolidation.

One unified entry replaces the gm-search / gm-enhance-query / gm-enhance-scene
trio. World-state context is always returned; RAG passages are optional and must
degrade gracefully when a campaign has no vector store (the test fixture omits the
12M vectors/ dir on purpose). Live grounded-passage behavior is smoke-verified in
the ticket QA against the DCC campaign that has vectors.
