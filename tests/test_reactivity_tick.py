"""Tests for reactivity-tick-wiring.

tick() fires matching consequences once per scene (dedup via last_fired_key) and
re-arms when the scene changes; tick_from_session() builds the world_state from
campaign state. The wrappers (gm-session.sh move, gm-time.sh) call this so firing
is automatic, not eyeballed.
